odin-recipes project 
----------------------
In the current project, I will be showcasing my current web development
skills with the creation of a basic recipe website built in HTML and
and maintained by GIT. 

By completion of this project, I will have shown how to use various tags, filters, and HTML code attributes
to create a basic recipe website with headers, lists, and proper HTML boilerplate. I will introduce GIT 
to maintain my project using various commands to add push and commit.
